### Generate base jupyterhub image for pyansys.com

This repository contains a `Dockerfile` to generate the base image
required for upstream images for pyansys.com.  Images are generated by
pushing a git tag starting with `v`.

Image is named and is built to be deployed at the MBU container
repository, but this will be changed to be deployed via dockerhub or
github docker

```
mapdlhelm.azurecr.io/jupyterlab_base:$VERSION
```

Obtain docker login credentials by following the steps at:
https://portal.azure.com/#@ansys.com/resource/subscriptions/2870ae10-53f8-46b1-8971-93761377c38b/resourceGroups/PyANSYS/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/mapdlhelm

It can be run locally by running the scripts in the following order:

- build_image.sh
- run_image.sh

#### Notes
 - We're currently using a custom image of pyvista at the moment, and
   this needs to be upgraded to the latest pyvista release.
 - GPU image on dev.pyansys.com contains additional GPU remote
   rendering features not included in this image.  Ping @akaszynski to
   create that branch.
